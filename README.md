# Early Version of a Website Project

This repository contains one of the **initial versions** of a website I worked on during my early career. The code was created under the permission of my employer at that time, and I was allowed to upload it here as part of my learning journey.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer  
- **This code is not perfect.** It has flaws, inconsistencies, and areas that could use improvement.  
- **It's a reflection of my early experience** and demonstrates my ability to tackle challenges and work with the knowledge I had at the time.  
- I intentionally preserved its original state, with minimal edits, to highlight my learning progress.

## Known Issues  
- **Inconsistent structure:** Some files and styles could be better organized.  
- **Code readability:** Variable names, comments, and formatting could be more professional.  
- **Accessibility:** Some elements lack proper focus states or alternative text.  
- **Best practices ignored:** Modern CSS/HTML practices are not fully applied.

## What This Code Demonstrates  
1. My early attempt at creating a responsive website.  
2. Basic use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for navigation, styling, and interactivity.  
3. The ability to implement features like:
   - Smooth scrolling with JavaScript.
   - Responsive navigation for different devices.
   - Simple visual effects like hover states and image scaling.

## Looking Back  
If I were to redo this project today, I would:  
- Use a CSS preprocessor like SCSS for better structure.  
- Implement semantic HTML5 for improved accessibility.  
- Follow modern best practices for JavaScript and responsive design.  

This project remains an important part of my journey as a developer
